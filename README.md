#Deep RL - Mountain Car Domain
This is my implementation of Mountain Car domain in reinforcement learning using neural network function approximation with Keras Deep Learning Library.  
I am motivated by this simple example of Keras playin catch []()  
My code is adapted from the above incorporated with Mountain car domain.

## DQN implementation
DQN implementation is based on the paper:  
Mnih, V., Kavukcuoglu, K., Silver, D., Graves, A., Antonoglou, I., Wierstra, D., & Riedmiller, M. (2013). Playing atari with deep reinforcement learning. arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.5602.
